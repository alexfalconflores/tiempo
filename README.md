# Tiempo
⚒️ I am working on the documentation, but each function is documented with examples.
You can try it:

```csharp
using Tiempo;

var dateTime = new DateTime(2024, 8, 31).SubtractDays(10);
// and more...
```

and thanks to intellisense you will get te new functions.
I am working to add more function. Thank you. 🙏
